I use this code to answer a question a friend had visiting Costa Rica?
Are three days in a row without any precipitation considerd as normal?
Or in other words: How many are?

This code will eventually give some statistical numbers and you may use it,
share it, distribute it for free or alter it to your use. I shall legaly 
not be held responsibel for any reliability, functionallity or what so ever.
